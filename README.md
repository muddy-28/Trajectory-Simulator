# Trajectory-Simulator
A really simple HTML5 projectile-motion simulation
Projectile Motion

Angle

Initial Speed

Sample Learning Goals
Predict how varying initial conditions affect a projectile path(various objects, angles, initial speed, mass, diameter, initial height, with and without air resistance).
Use reasoning to explain the predictions.
Explain common projectile motion terms in their own words. (launch angle, initial speed, initial height, range, final height, time).
Describe why using the simulation is a good method for studying projectiles.
